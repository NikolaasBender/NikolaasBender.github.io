						I build and learn. I love to learn and my favorite way to learn is by building. A lot of my repositories are records of me
						learning something new or they are for school work. There are some more cheeky projects in there too, mosty because I found myself 
						with some free time and an itch to build something. That combination often doesn't occur with a (at the time of writing this) strong
						interest in robotics and artificial intelligence.</p>

					<p class="card-text" style="font-size: 24px; " >Where I am now started with a joke during summer school when I joked about building a small
						robot to roam around the engineering building at CU and knock over trash cans. I deigned and built a crude prototype, then a professor
						me to to take a robotics class. The robotics class had us build software to race a small car around a hall way. In the class we learned
						about core robotics concepts and we had to build path finding algorithms, kalman filters, and even implement realtime object detection. 
						Autonomy is one hell of a drug. I ended up as part of the CU sub terranian challenge team and taking another robotics class where we were
						allowed to design and build our own robot and our own midterm and final. Taking the knowledge from the previous class we built a robot
						that would move around our campus autonomously. Through reading for this class I also found myself deeply interested in deep reinforcement	
						learning and its application to robotics. Thats where My story ends in the fall of 2019, however there is adventure on the horizon, so I
						know this section will get longer in the future.</p>
