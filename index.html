					  <h2>Who am I</h2>
					<p class="card-text" style="font-size: 24px; " >I'm Nick Bender, I'm a computer science student at the University of Colorado Boulder. 
						I build and learn. I love to learn and my favorite way to learn is by building. A lot of my repositories are records of me
						learning something new or they are for school work. There are some more cheeky projects in there too, mosty because I found myself 
						with some free time and an itch to build something. That combination often doesn't occur with a (at the time of writing this) strong
						interest in robotics and artificial intelligence.</p>

						<h2>How I got here</h2>
					<p class="card-text" style="font-size: 24px; " >Where I am now started with a joke during summer school when I joked about building a small
						robot to roam around the engineering building at CU and knock over trash cans. I deigned and built a crude prototype, then a professor
						me to to take a robotics class. The robotics class had us build software to race a small car around a hall way. In the class we learned
						about core robotics concepts and we had to build path finding algorithms, kalman filters, and even implement realtime object detection. 
						Autonomy is one hell of a drug. I ended up as part of the CU sub terranian challenge team and taking another robotics class where we were
						allowed to design and build our own robot and our own midterm and final. Taking the knowledge from the previous class we built a robot
						that would move around our campus autonomously. Through reading for this class I also found myself deeply interested in deep reinforcement	
						learning and its application to robotics. Thats where My story ends in the fall of 2019, however there is adventure on the horizon, so I
						know this section will get longer in the future.</p>

							<h2>Lucky #7</h2>
							<p class="card-text">
							This was a project for advanced robotics where we automated a small remote control car using cameras, lidar, and a small computer to drive
							around a section of hall way as part of a class competition. We used ROS for coordinating control of the car and all of the car's components. The project
							taught us about IOT computers, ROS, SLAM, kalman filters, power management, and camera systems to name some of our bigger struggles and some of the larger
							lessons we learned.

							<h2>Capable Octopus</h2>
							<p class="card-text">
							This project was a project as part of the autonomous vehicle competition class where we took the option of devising our own project 
							to work on instead of making a small autonomous racecar. The robot platform we used was a clearpath jackal, for cumpute resources we used an intel nuc 
							and an nvidia agx xavier. For sensors we used 3 of intel's d430 realsense cameras and gps. The goal of the project was to make the robot autonomousely 
							navigate around our campus. For control we used a semantic segmentation network to follow sidewalks and stereo slam to map our campus. This project 
							also helped some of the team members work on their capstone projetcs. For me it taught me more about segmentation networks, reinforcement learning, and
							it hardened my knowledge of ROS.

							<h2>MARBLE GUI</h2>
							<p class="card-text">
							This is not a project I started but I intend to finish. I am working on the gui for managing CU's robotic deployment at the DARPA sub terranian
							challenge. I have been optimizing what exists and expanding functonality. The challenge that the GUI has to overcome is that it has to help the mission
							comander manage many robots with relative ease. The robots report artifcats and artifact locations during the event and the GUI fuses those artifact locations
							then sends that information to DARPA's server. Seeing what each robot has reported can become overwhelming when there are 10 robots, I try to make that
							amout of information managable.

							<h2>Co-Lab</h2>
							<p class="card-text">
							This project was for a software development class. It was supposed to be like jira mixed with twitter. We built it using Golang and html, and it 
							was a bit of a disaster. Learning Go on a project of this scale was difficult and my own leadership on the project could have been better becuase I didn't
							excite my team and keep them working to their full potential. While the project did not earn a high grade it did teach us some lessons so it wasn't a complete
							failure.

							<h2>Bumble Bot</h2>
							<p class="card-text">
							This was my first attempt to build a robot. It started as a joke that I should build a small robot to harass one of the instructors of a course
							I was taking. The joke was funny to all parties involved including the instructor in question, so I started designing and building. As this was my first 
							robotics project I didn't know anything beyond the fact that python on a raspberry pi could control some motors and the raspberry pi could also use ultra
							sound distance sensors to navigate. The project never really went anywhere but it got me excited for robotics and it helped me get into the advanced 
							robotics class where I learned most of what I know in robotics.
